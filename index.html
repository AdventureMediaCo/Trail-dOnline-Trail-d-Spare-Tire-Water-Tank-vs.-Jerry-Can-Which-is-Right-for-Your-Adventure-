                <p>
                    When you are planning your next <a href="https://trailedonline.com/what-is-overlanding/"><u><b>overlanding trip</b></u></a>, water storage will be #1 on the list. The problem comes with how you are going to store this. The longer you are traveling, the more water you will need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You really have two different ways of storing the water. You can use a conventional Jerry can or water container.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or you can use an auxiliary tank which will normally attach to the vehicle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this post we will look at the pros and cons of the <a href="https://trailedonline.com/product/traild-6-gallon-spare-tank/"><u><b>Trail’d tank</b></u></a> vs a jerry can and give you the best choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are five recommended considerations when you are looking to take water with you for an overlanding or camping trip.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will run through these below and let you know which one we would recommend between a Spare tire water tank – like the Trail’d tank or a Jerry can.
                </p>

            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>1. Capacity and Space Efficiency:</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Spare Tire Water Tank:</b> These tanks are designed to fit within the unused space of your vehicle’s spare tire, allowing for a more efficient use of space. Depending on the size, a spare tire water tank, like the Trail’d tank, can hold up to 30 liters or more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For space efficiency you are not going to beat a spare tire water tank. The reason for this is they use NO primary storage space and will install in the spare tire space. Capacity is not a slouch either, the Trail’d tank will give you the ability to carry 6 gallons of water effortlessly and you can stack up to 3 times. This means you can take up to 18 gallons with you – without taking storage space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sure, you will have a weight increase but you will also have this with a Jerry can. The difference is that the weight will be more balanced with the Trail’d tank and central to the vehicle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Jerry Can:</b> Traditional jerry cans typically have a capacity of about 20 liters. And while you can stack multiple cans, they take up more primary space relative to their capacity and every inch of primary space is valuable. They also need to be stored in the back of the vehicle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can lead to leaking, the jerry cans can also be thrown about while overlanding and in the worst case, you may lose them and not know until you need them most.
                </p>
                <h2>2. Ease of Use:</h2>
                <p>
                    Ease of use is key when you are deciding which method to use for carrying your water. When you need the water, how difficult is it to unmount the tank and make use of it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Spare Tire Water Tank:</b> This is made super easy. A quick unmounting means that you can use this when you need it. You will not have to go searching underneath a ton of equipment. Simply unmount from the spare tire slot and you are ready to go. Or if you plum the tanks you will have instant access.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Jerry Can:</b> This is also easy to use. The problem is that to carry your water you may need a lot of jerry cans. They will be heavy. When you are overlanding they can move around and you will need to search for them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are relatively easy to use – but we recommend the spare tire water tank as the main choice for how easy they are to use and unmount.
                </p>
                <h2>3. Durability and Longevity:</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Spare Tire Water Tank:</b> Made from durable materials and designed to be protected by the tire, these tanks are built to last. The Trail’d tank, for example, is UV-resistant and built to withstand the rigors of off-road adventures and debris.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Jerry Can:</b> While they are robust, they are more exposed to the elements, which can lead to faster wear and tear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we explored above, the problem is that you are overlanding!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Driving the trails, bumping the tanks and the vehicle about – no jerry can will withstand this for a prolonged time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We highly recommend the Trail’d tank as this is durable by the way it has been designed but also because of the way it is stored.
                </p>

                <h2>4. Aesthetics and Stealth:</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Spare Tire Water Tank:</b> One of the cool features about spare tire tanks like the Trail’d is that they are stealthy. It’s not immediately obvious you’re carrying extra water, which is great for those who prefer a clean look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apart from this, as we mentioned above – the weight being central will make vehicle handling far easier while overlanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will have a little more weight but this will help make the vehicle stable. We highly recommend the Trail’d tank for the way it will look and also for the weight distribution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Jerry Can:</b> These are pretty obvious. If you’ve got a jerry can, everyone knows it. They can also move around a lot and create problems if you end up losing a few on a trail.
                </p>
                <h2>5. Cost-Effectiveness:</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Spare Tire Water Tank:</b> Although the initial investment might be slightly higher, in the long run, the durability, storage capacity, space efficiency, and ease of use make spare tire tanks a more cost-effective choice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Jerry Can:</b> They might be cheaper initially, but you might end up replacing them more often. Plus, considering the convenience and capacity, the value might not be as great.
                </p>
                <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                <p>
                    While jerry cans have been the traditional choice for many adventurers for years, the benefits of a spare tire water tank, particularly the Trail’d tank, make it a superior choice for modern-day adventurers. Whether it’s the efficient use of space, the durability, or the stealthy aesthetics, the Trail’d tank ticks all the boxes for the avid traveler.
                </p>
